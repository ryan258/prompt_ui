## üì¶ Import/Export CSV

- **Export:** Click "Export CSV" to download all your snippets.
- **Import:** Click "Import CSV" and select a CSV file.  
  - The import is robust: it supports quoted fields, Excel/Sheets exports, and skips duplicates.
  - The expected header is:  
    ```
    id,title,content,tags,createdAt,updatedAt,isFavorite
    ```
  - Each row should match this order (empty fields are fine).

## üìù Development Notes

- **Accessibility:** All interactive elements are keyboard accessible and use ARIA attributes. Expand/collapse supports keyboard and screen readers.
- **Expandable Previews:** Cards can be expanded/collapsed independently. Collapsed cards show a multi-line preview (up to 3 lines).
- **Profile-specific data:** Snippets are stored per Chrome profile. To sync between browsers, use the export/import feature.
- **Testing:**  
  ```sh
  npm test
  ```
- **Linting & Formatting:**  
  ```sh
  npm run lint
  npm run format
  ```
